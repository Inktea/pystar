In the Beginning was the Command Line Badge
===========================================

In the Beginning was the Command Line is a book by Neal Stephenson. Unlike many of his other works, it is short and available for free (legally) download on the internet. The first part of this badge is to do just that. Go here to complete this task: http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html

The second part of this badge is to read the section entitled "THE HOLE HAWG OF OPERATING SYSTEMS."

**Extra Credit**: If you want, you can complete the second part of the badge using only the commandline. Open a CLI and navigate to where the text is stored (and perhaps named something like command.txt) and run the following command::

    $ grep -A 22 "THE HOLE HAWG OF OPERATING SYSTEMS" command.txt

What does this command return? What do you think ``grep`` does? After you've read the text, play around some with ``grep`` - it's pretty neat!
