Advice for Learners
-------------------

*   ask questions of each other first, then your guides.
*   if you are confused, or lost, back up, try again.  
*   do experiments!
*   break down tasks into repeatable, understandable parts.
*   even expert coders write lots of broken code.  mistakes are normal.
*   the computer does exactly what you tell it to, not what you want it to do.
*   `your own pace` is the right pace.
*   your background is a good background, and you have things to contribute.

* hard-refresh your web browser
* try a different browser
* re-read the instructions
* make some tea
* check for spelling errors
* examine the object in a python shell
